## Intro

In my personal opinion, who people are as coders and who they are as a person are **very** intertwined, so I'm going to start off this page witha picture/meme that I think best represents both who I am as a person and as a coder.

**_Are you ready?_**

Before we continue, it's important for me to mention that I have ADHD. As much as I try to not let it define me, it is baked into my brain and the way that I work and I find that using as the scope in which I function is helpful way of framing the way that I am and the way that I code. With that out of the way, let's move on to who I am as a person and a coder

## Who am I? (As a person)

As mentioned above, my ADHD comes with both it's struggles and it's bonuses. Some common symptoms are:
> Impulsiveness
> Disorganization
> Poor time management skills
> Problems focusing on a task
> Trouble multitasking
> Excessive activity or restlessness
> Trouble coping with stress
I used to let these symptoms, and more, hold me back but now I see them as ways to get ahead. For example, my impulsivity can lead me to try creative new solutions to problems that I hadn't thought of before. Other symptoms that are more directly setbacks, like the poor time management or the trouble multitasking, I am acutely aware of and take the necessary steps to remove those situations from my life.
