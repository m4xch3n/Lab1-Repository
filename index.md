## Intro

In my personal opinion, who people are as coders and who they are as a person are **very** intertwined, so I'm going to start off this page witha picture/meme that I think best represents both who I am as a person and as a coder.

**_Are you ready?_**

Before we continue, it's important for me to mention that I have ADHD. As much as I try to not let it define me, it is baked into my brain and the way that I work and I find that using as the scope in which I function is helpful way of framing the way that I am and the way that I code. With that out of the way, let's move on to who I am as a person and a coder

## Who am I? (As a person)

As mentioned above, my ADHD comes with both it's struggles and it's bonuses. Some common symptoms are:
> Impulsiveness

> Disorganization

> Poor time management skills

> Problems focusing on a task

> Trouble multitasking

> Excessive activity or restlessness

> Trouble coping with stress

I used to let these symptoms, and more, hold me back but now I see them as ways to get ahead. For example, my impulsivity can lead me to try creative new solutions to problems that I hadn't thought of before. Other symptoms that are more directly setbacks, like the poor time management or the trouble multitasking, I am acutely aware of and take the necessary steps to remove those situations from my life.

In addition to all of that, I am a very creative human being. As an ICAM Music major here at UCSD, I spend lots of time using technology to be creative, mainly focusing on my music production efforts. In my spare time, I enjoy a plethora of hobbies, including but not limited to:
 - Gaming
 - DJing
 - Playing guitar
 - Going to the gym

## Who am I? (As a coder)

So how does this translate to being a coder? For one, my ADHD translates to my code often times being slightly convoluded, as I will often get new ideas in the middle of executing the original ideas and attempt to splice them together without thinking about the bigger picture (impulsivity). Another way this translates to my coding style is that to counteract my own tendencies, I like to meticulously plan and set up my code before I get started, so that I have no room to "freestyle" so to speak. I am a massive prepper and believe that there is no such thing as being too prepared, so I spend most of my time not actually coding, rather trying to pre-plan my ideas as much as possible. In general I try to follow these steps before I start to put ideas into code:

1. Read the instructions thoughroughly and mark the important sections
2. List out the important things my code must succeed at
3. Break down the list into smaller problems that I can easily visualize
4. Come up with a way to solve for each one
5. See if those solutions interface properly
6. If they do, start to code
7. If not, redo step 4 and try again

These steps help mitigate the challenges I face while coding and allow me to stimulate both the creative and the technical aspects of my brain.

## Final Thoughts and Next Steps

As much as I wish I could `sudo rm -rf /*` my brain from time to time, I cannot, and throughout my time as UCSD I have learned how to use it as a tool to use to my advantage rather than something that holds me back. I'm excited for this class because it will help me gain a better understading myself and the work world in which I intend to join very soon. So, both for myself and because I need to fit a task list in here somewhere I am going to be creating a list of things I want to learn by the end of the quarter, and come back to check them off as time goes on.
 - [ ] Get used to coding in a team environment
 - [ ] Get better with industry tools and learn to speak some jargon
 - [ ] Upgrade my communication skills and get close with my team
 - [ ] Get better at coding

and finally
 - [ ] Become confident calling myself a software engineer

I hope I can all of these goals and more and am very very excited for this upcoming quarter! Thanks for reading!
